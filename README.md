# Celestial-Helix
I wanted to test out a tactical, turnbased rpg that wasn't limited to a grid. So, I took a look at other games that did that. The inspirations for this project were Divinity Original Sin 2 and Valkyria Chronicles. When the turn for a player's unit comes up, the player controls that unit similar to a third person shooter.
